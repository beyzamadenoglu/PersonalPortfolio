                        Hi, it's me Beyza MadenoÄŸlu. I graduated from Istanbul Aydin University Computer Engineering Department in June 2021. I have been working as a Software QA Engineer in a squad that provide Call Center Solutions at VodafoneTR for more than a year. During this time, I focused on the Frontend field and started to develop myself. I have developed various projects with React in the frontend area. (Like this page &#128579;.) I also attended a React Bootcamp, which I believe has been very beneficial for me. The next thing that will take me one step further will be to start a professional career as a Frontend Developer.
